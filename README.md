# A journey to ZKP

## Plan

- Learn the maths
- zk-SNARKs
  - Maksym Petkus's posts
  - Ariel Gabizon's posts
  - Vitalik Buterin's posts

## Learn the Maths : Khan Academy

Khan Academy provides two great courses dedicated to learning polynomials and modular arithmetic.

1. [Polynomials](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-polynomials)
2. [Modular Arithmetic](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography#modarithmetic)

## Why and How zk-SNARK Works by Maksym Petkus

[Maksym Petkus](https://twitter.com/maksympetkus) has written 8 excellents posts explaining zk-SNARKs in detail.
Every piece of maths involved is described in detailed, computing the formulas yourselves is a must to properly understand the posts imo.

Based on [his paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07221).

## Explaining SNARKs by Ariel Gabizon

Ariel Gabizon has written 7 posts explaining zk-SNARKs. Takes a different approach compared to Maksym's posts and definitely useful !

1. [Explaining SNARKs Part I: Homomorphic Hidings](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-explain/)
2. [Explaining SNARKs Part II: Blind Evaluation of Polynomials](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-explain2/)
3. [Explaining SNARKs Part III: The Knowledge of Coefficient Test and Assumption](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-explain3/)
4. [Explaining SNARKs Part IV: How to make Blind Evaluation of Polynomials Verifiable](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-explain4/)
5. [Explaining SNARKs Part V: From Computations to Polynomials](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-explain5/)
6. [Explaining SNARKs Part VI: The Pinocchio Protocol](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-explain6/)
7. [Explaining SNARKs Part VII: Pairings of Elliptic Curves](https://electriccoin.co/blog/snark-explain7/)

## Vitalik Buterin

The unknown founder of Ethereum has written a few posts related to zk-SNARKs and the math behind.

1. [Quadratic Arithmetic Programs: from Zero to Hero](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649)
