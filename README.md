## Open Questions

- Different exponent, same result : why is it so hard ?
- Homomorphic properties : why does it allow to encrypt a value and be able to apply arithmetic operations on such encryption ? Why are there limits such as multiplication between two encrypted values ? Why multiplying an encrypted value and an unencrypted value works ?
